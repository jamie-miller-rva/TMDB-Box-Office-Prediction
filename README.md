# TMDB-Box-Office-Prediction
Data Description In this dataset, you are provided with 7398 movies and a variety of metadata obtained from The Movie Database (TMDB). Movies are labeled with id. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, and countries.  You are predicting the worldwide revenue for 4398 movies in the test file.  Note - many movies are remade over the years, therefore it may seem like multiple instance of a movie may appear in the data, however they are different and should be considered separate movies. In addition, some movies may share a title, but be entirely unrelated.  E.g. The Karate Kid (id: 5266) was released in 1986, while a clearly (or maybe just subjectively) inferior remake (id: 1987) was released in 2010. Also, while the Frozen (id: 5295) released by Disney in 2013 may be the household name, don't forget about the less-popular Frozen (id: 139) released three years earlier about skiers who are stranded on a chairlift...
